      <h1>🐢 1. Milo the Time-Lost Turtle (Adventure / Comedy)</h1>
      <p>
        Milo was an ordinary park turtle—slow, chill, and very committed to
        sunbathing. One day, he accidentally crawled onto a glowing wristwatch
        someone dropped near the pond. Zap! Milo was sent hopping through time.
      </p>
      <p>
        One moment he was dodging dinosaurs, the next he was sipping smoothies
        in the future where turtles ran the city (finally). The problem? Every
        jump made him slightly faster—which stressed him out immensely. Milo
        just wanted to go home and be slow again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using his new speed and old wisdom, Milo learned that being fast wasn’t
        the point. Being steady was. With a final leap, he returned to his pond…
        just in time for a nap.

      <h1>🤖 2. Beep-Boop Benny (Heartfelt / Slice of Life)</h1>
      <p>
        Benny was a tiny robot built to clean floors in a noisy apartment
        building. He beeped, he booped, and he polished like a champ. But
        secretly, Benny loved music.
      </p>
      <p>
        At night, when everyone slept, Benny used his cleaning tools to make
        beats—brooms for drums, cups for chimes. One evening, a little girl
        heard him and started dancing. Soon, the whole building joined in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Benny was reprogrammed to clean and perform at parties. He still cleaned
        floors… but now he cleaned hearts too. 💛

      <h1>🧙‍♀️ 3. Zola the Forgetful Witch (Fantasy / Silly)</h1>
      <p>
        Zola was a powerful witch with one tiny problem: she forgot her spells
        halfway through.
      </p>
      <p>
        She once tried to summon a dragon and got a confused duck instead. When
        she meant to turn invisible, only her shoes vanished. Still, everyone
        loved Zola because she never gave up—and her mistakes were usually
        helpful in weird ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, when the town was in danger, Zola didn’t remember a single
        spell. So she improvised—using kindness, courage, and creativity. The
        problem was solved without magic at all.
      </p>
      <p>Turns out, Zola’s greatest power was herself.</p>
